**TO DO** 
DIRECT TO INITIATIVE PAGE
- Currently using ticket_id as param.  Need to redirect to ObjectId value instead.
- How to use the following to disable selection click
<DataGrid checkboxSelection disableSelectionOnClick {...data} />

ADD To ESTIMATION
- Store ticked initiatives using useState
- When user selects "Add to Estimation" button use onClick to capture event
- useEffect 
- Store initiatives ticked to Estimation table

Question:  
- What should then display on the Dashboard. Should initiatives added to Estimation be greyed out and we have a button so user can remove/delete initiative from Estimation table?

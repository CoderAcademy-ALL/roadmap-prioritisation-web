**TO DO - Add to Estimatio feature**

- Store ticked initiatives using useState
- When user selects "Add to Estimation" button use onClick to capture event
- Store initiatives ticked to Estimation table

Question:  

What should then display on the Dashboard. Should initiatives added to Estimation be greyed out and we have 
a button so user can remove/delete initiative from Estimation table?
